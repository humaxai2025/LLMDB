- 🤯 **Too many models**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Mistral, and 39+ other providers
- 💰 **Complex pricing**: Per-token costs, input vs output pricing, varying by provider
- 📊 **Hard to compare**: Context windows range from 4K to 2M tokens
- 🔍 **Scattered info**: Official docs across dozens of websites
- 💻 **Integration confusion**: Different SDKs, APIs, and authentication methods
- 🔄 **Outdated information**: Models and pricing change frequently

### The Solution
LLM DB gives you:
- ✅ **Instant comparison** of 150 production models in a sortable table
- ✅ **Enhanced cost calculator** with visual charts and budget tracking
- ✅ **Token optimization assistant** to reduce costs by 20-40%
- ✅ **Interactive usage dashboard** with detailed analytics and trends
- ✅ **Smart model recommender** to find the perfect model for your needs
- ✅ **Accurate token counting** with real-time cost estimation
- ✅ **Usage analytics** to track your LLM spending and patterns
- ✅ **Quality scores** based on benchmark performance
- ✅ **Python code samples** ready to copy-paste for every model
- ✅ **Advanced filtering** by price, context size, provider, status, and more

  provider: "Provider Name",
  contextWindow: 128000,
  inputCostPer1M: 10.00,
  outputCostPer1M: 30.00,
  releaseDate: "2024-11-08",
  description: "Model description",
  strengths: ["Complex tasks", "Long documents", "High performance"],
  apiInfo: {
    endpoint: "https://api.provider.com/v1/chat/completions",
    authentication: "API Key (Bearer token)",
    rateLimits: "10,000 TPM on tier 1",
