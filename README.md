## 🎯 Why LLM DB?

Choosing the right LLM can be overwhelming. Different providers, different pricing models, varying context windows, and scattered documentation make it hard to make informed decisions. **LLM DB solves this by putting all the information you need in one place.**

### The Problem
- 🤯 **Too many models**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Mistral, and 39+ other providers
- 💰 **Complex pricing**: Per-token costs, input vs output pricing, varying by provider
- 📊 **Hard to compare**: Context windows range from 4K to 2M tokens
- 🔍 **Scattered info**: Official docs across dozens of websites
- 💻 **Integration confusion**: Different SDKs, APIs, and authentication methods
- 🔄 **Outdated information**: Models and pricing change frequently

### The Solution
LLM DB gives you:
- ✅ **Instant comparison** of 150 production models in a sortable table
- ✅ **Real-time cost calculator** to estimate your expenses
- ✅ **Quality scores** based on benchmark performance
- ✅ **Python code samples** ready to copy-paste for every model
- ✅ **Advanced filtering** by price, context size, provider, status, and more
- ✅ **Side-by-side comparison** of up to 4 models
- ✅ **API availability info** with endpoints, authentication, and rate limits
- ✅ **Status indicators** showing NEW, UPDATED, and DEPRECATED models

## 🛠️ Customization

### Adding New Models

Edit `app/data/llm-data.ts`:

```typescript
{
  id: "model-id",
  name: "Model Name",
  provider: "Provider Name",
  contextWindow: 128000,
  inputCostPer1M: 10.00,
  outputCostPer1M: 30.00,
  releaseDate: "2024-11-08",
  description: "Model description",
  strengths: ["Complex tasks", "Long documents", "High performance"],
  apiInfo: {
    endpoint: "https://api.provider.com/v1/chat/completions",
    authentication: "API Key (Bearer token)",
    rateLimits: "10,000 TPM on tier 1",
    regionalAvailability: "Global",
    documentation: "https://docs.provider.com/api"
  },
  status: {
    isNew: true,
    pricingUpdated: true,
    pricingUpdateDate: "2024-11-08"
  }
}
```

### Updating Pricing

Pricing is in `app/data/llm-data.ts`. Update `inputCostPer1M` and `outputCostPer1M` fields. When updating pricing, also update the status badge:

```typescript
status: {
  pricingUpdated: true,
  pricingUpdateDate: "2025-11-08"  // Today's date
}
```

### Styling

Customize in:
